//Week 6 Java-Script
//Today we are learining how to setup our workspace.
// NOTE- I'll use VS Code on my left and chrome on my right which has MDN, devtools and github open.
// TODO- Have a look through GiHub student offers and sign up to software for the course.
// NOTE- Javascript is a set of instructions for your website/app to follow.
// NOTE- Console Commands-
console.log("Hello World")
//console.dir(document)
console.table({first:"test",val:9});
console.error("Hello World")

// Lesson Challenge
console.log("Hello World")
var a = "This is my test code for the lesson challenge, I hope it works - Flynn"
console.log(a)

//window.alert() displays alerts in a new window example below
//window.alert("Ooopsie Daisies")
//alert("Hello world!")

//Code Snippet (Alert is commented out as it won't run in VS Code)
var myName = "Flynn";
var myCourse = "JavaScript";
console.log(myName);
//alert("Welcome Traveller!");
var myAge = 20;
console.log(myAge);

//This code declares two variables myName and myCourse.
//Then prints the value of myName in console.
//Then prints alert in the browser.
//Then declares myAge variable.
//Then prints the value of myAge in console.
