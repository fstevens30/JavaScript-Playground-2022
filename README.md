# JavaScript Playground 2022
## Welcome to my JavaScript playground.
I will use this Repo for notes and class activities in SDV503.
All notes and practice is located in the corresponding weeks branch.
Javascript is confusijg but fun and I am enjoying learning it!

## Personal Activities 
This Repo now also contains any JavaScript that I want to test and work on throughout semester 2 of 2022. I have been putting testing enviroments for any freeCodeCamp activities.
